    Remember the JS circle assignment you did?  Now, update your code with three different versions.

    Version 1: where you're using ES5 but NOT prototype
    Version 2: where you're using ES5 with prototype
    Version 3: where you're using ES6
    These repetitions are designed to help you get familiar with all the various ways of creating a Javascript object.
